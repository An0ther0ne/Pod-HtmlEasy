# Pod-HtmlEasy

This is fork from original [Pod-HtmlEasy-v1.1.11a](https://metacpan.org/pod/release/GLEACH/Pod-HtmlEasy-v1.1.11a/lib/Pod/HtmlEasy.pm) authorship by Graciliano M. P. <gm@virtuasites.com.br>

With some bug fixed from me. 
In addition, I add my own POD to the HTML parser 'tohtml.pl' adapted for myself.
